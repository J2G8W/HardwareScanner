# HardwareScanner
This project was my first project created in C++ and aims to scan hardware connected to Windows machines.
I created it to analyse whether my camera and microphone are activated and which processes are using them.
It is best run from a system level (this is what the .bat file is designed for) to detect any processes that are also running at system level
